### Overview

This repository serves a few main purposes.

1. Hydrofabric processes are intentionally modular. This package provides a collection of R package that are designed for hydroscience. (e.g. tidyverse for hydrofabric development)

2. It provides the utilities to subset an area upstream of a location (XY), hydrofabric ID, indexed hydrolocation (e.g. NWIS gage, HUC12 or NID) or NHDPlus COMID from the full CONUS data product.

3. It provides a wide range of documentation including the hydrofabric and cross section data model, the origins and development of the product, subsetting, and attribute creation can be found on this products main [landing page](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/) under [articles](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/index.html).


## Cloud Native Data Archives

NextGen artifacts are distributed by _NHDPlusV2_ **V**ector **P**rocessing **U**nits and are generated from a set of national reference datasets built in collaboration between NOAA, the USGS, and Lynker for federal water modeling efforts. These artifacts are designed to be easily updated, manipulated, and quality controlled to meet the needs of a wide range of modeling tasks while leveraging the best possible input data.


NextGen artifacts are publicly available through Lynker (www.lynker-spatial.com). For each VPU a geopackage that contains all tables, spatial data, and lookups relevant to a hydrofabric data model

## R Package Installation and Use

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("NOAA-OWP/hydrofabric")
```

```{r}
library(hydrofabric)
```

`library(hydrofabric)` will load the core packages: 

* [nhdplusTools](https://github.com/doi-usgs/nhdplusTools/) for network manipulation
* [hydrofab](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrofab) a tool set for "fabricating" multiscale hydrofabrics
* [ngen.hydrofab](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen.hydrofab) NextGen extensions for hydrofab
* [climateR](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/climateR) for accessing remote data resources for parameter and attributes estimation
* [zonal](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/zonal) for catchment parameter estimation

Additionally it will load key spatial data science libraries: 

* `arrow`
* `terra`
* `sf`
* `dplyr`
* `glue`

# Hydrofabric Subsetter

```{r}
# A hydrolocation URI
hl = 'Gages-04185000'

# The output directory
o = "data/gray_test.gpkg"

# Build subset
## caching the downloaded VPU files to "data" and writing all layers to "o"
subset_network(hl_uri = hl, cache_dir = "data", outfile = o)

{
plot(sf::read_sf(o, "divides")$geom)
plot(sf::read_sf(o, "flowpaths")$geom, col = "blue", add = TRUE)
plot(sf::read_sf(o, "nexus")$geom, col = "red", pch = 16, add = TRUE)
}

```

We have _also_ created cloud based community subsetter. GO binaries of these can be installed at the [release page](https://github.com/LynkerIntel/hfsubset/releases).


## Hydrofabric Characteristic Data

A wide range of data can be appended to the hydrofabric (subsets) from resources including NOAA core modules, streamcat, hydroatlas, USGS catchment characteristics, and more. 

Preliminary documentation of these can be found [here](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/hydrofabric/wiki/Data-Access-Patterns).


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(c("man/figures/lynker-logo.png","man/figures/noaa-logo.png", 'man/figures/usgs-logo.png'))
# library(cowplot)
# xx = ggdraw() + 
#   draw_image("man/figures/lynker-logo.png", width = 0.33, height = .25, y = .05) + 
#   draw_image("man/figures/noaa-logo.png", width = 0.33,  height = .35, x = 0.33) + 
#   draw_image("man/figures/usgs-logo.png", width = 0.33,height = .25, x = 0.66, y = .05)
# 
# cowplot::save_plot(xx, filename = "man/figures/logos.png")

# Background

The NextGen artifacts are a _model application_ dataset built to meet the aims of [NextGen](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen). By design, these artifacts are derived from a set of general authoritative data products outlined in figure 1 that have been built in close collaboration with the USGS. 

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/roadmap.png")
```

These include a set of base data that improves the network topology and geometry validity while defining a set of community hydrolocations (POIs). These 4 data products are used to build an intermediate refactored network from which one hydrofabric network has been aggregated to a set of community hydrolocations (minimal network), and one has been aggregated to a more consistent size (3-10 sqkm) with enforced POI locations (target distribution). NextGen specifically is derived from the target size aggregated product while the upcoming developments on the [National Hydrologic Model (NHM)](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/national-hydrologic-model-infrastructure) will be built from the community minimal network. 

While these two aggregations serve a wide range of federal modeling needs, our focus on open source software development and workflows allow interested parties to build there own networks starting with either the 4 reference datasets, or the refactored network!

# Resources

- The hydrofabric builds on the OGC [HY_Features conceptual model](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html), the [Hydrofabric Logical model](https://docs.ogc.org/per/22-040.html), and the proposed [Hydrofabric Data Model](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/hf_dm.html).

- The reference, refactor, minimal, and target hydrofabrics can all be accessed [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/60be0e53d34e86b93891012b). A high level introduction to these resources can be found on the [USGS Water Data blog](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/hydrofabric/).
