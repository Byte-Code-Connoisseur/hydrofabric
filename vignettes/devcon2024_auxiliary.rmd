# Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial on leveraging the robust subsetting features in R to extract geospatial data effectively. Throughout this vigennet, we'll delve into using identifiers to retrieve specific geospatial data from geosptial fabrics for areas of interest. Our journey will involve not only fetching geospatial attributes but also extracting and visualizing additional data like 3D channel geometry and accessing routlink files. Let's dive in and explore the geospatial information!

## Location of Interest and Subset

First, let's ensure that we have the necessary libraries loaded:

```{r}
library(hydrofabric)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
```

Now, let's extract the geospatial fabric for `comid = 101`:

```{r}
geosptial_output <- get_subset(comid = 101, 
                                source  = "s3://lynker-spatial/hydrofabric",
                                type = 'reference',
                                hf_version = "2.2")
```

That's easy!

## Accessing routelink files

## 3D Channel Geometry

One of our key projects of NOAA is the 3D River initiative. Our main goal is to boost innovation in river morphology research. We're committed to improving hydrological modeling by integrating additional tools and fostering interdisciplinary studies in river ecosystems.

- **3D River Channel Cross Sections**: Our platform offers a comprehensive 3D representation of channel geometry and cross sections for the CONUS. This dataset, constructed from a 10-meter Digital Elevation Model (DEM), incorporates meticulous details crucial for delineating river floodplains, rectifying DEM inaccuracies, preserving the consistent decrease in elevation along the river's path from upstream to downstream, and more. Detailed information regarding our cross-sectional data model can be accessed [here](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/cs_dm.html). Additionally, we employ machine learning methodologies to address gaps in bathymetric data [see this article](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/07-channel-geometry.html).

- **Features**: Our platform dynamically generates cross sections updated with survey data whenever available. Offering over 10 cross sections per flowline, each with elevation points spaced at 1-meter intervals, it spans approximately 2.7 million reaches, providing indispensable data for comprehensive analysis of river morphology. Leveraging a 10-meter DEM integrated with bathymetric data derived from machine learning algorithms, this feature facilitates the derivation of river topobathy information through the Reference Fabric, enabling exhaustive watershed-level inquiries. This advancement enhances routing accuracy within hydrological models such as the National Water Model T-route, augments bathymetric representation in Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM), and enables a myriad of comprehensive scientific analyses through the 3D River project.

We have several papers underway base on this project including:

To access the 3D data we can use the subset derived earlier by narrowing down our search, we extract the target VPU and finding the most upstream watershed:

```{r}
# Retrive vpu ID
vpu <- unique(geosptial_output$network$vpuid)
hf_ids <- unique(geosptial_output$network$id)

max_seq = which.max(geosptial_output$network$hydroseq)
watershed_id<- geosptial_output$network$id[max_seq]
```

Since the 3D channel data is developed for the next-generation fabric, we need to cross-walk from the reference fabric to the next generation:

```{r}
conus_net <- arrow::open_dataset('s3://lynker-spatial/hydrofabric/v20.1/conus_net.parquet') %>% 
              filter(hf_id %in% hf_ids, vpu == vpu) %>% 
              select(id, hf_id) %>% 
              collect()

# now extract the identifiers
ids <- unique(conus_net$id)
```

Now we can use the IDs to read the cross-sections from 3D channel geometry:

```{r}
version = "20.1"
source = "s3://lynker-spatial/hydrofabric"

hook = glue("{source}/v{version}/3D/cross-sections/nextgen_{vpu}_cross_sections.parquet")
cs = arrow::open_dataset(hook) %>% 
  filter(hy_id %in% ids) %>% 
  collect()
```

We can then select a single cross-section for a next-gen ID and plot it:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# lets look at a signle cross section 

target_id <-  unique(arrow::open_dataset('s3://lynker-spatial/hydrofabric/v20.1/conus_net.parquet') %>% 
              filter(hf_id == watershed_id, vpu == vpu) %>% 
              select(id) %>% 
              collect())$id

target_cs_id <- 1
cs_sub <- cs %>% filter(hy_id == target_id & cs_id == target_cs_id)

# now we plot it
unique_categories <- unique(cs_sub$point_type)
category_color_map <- c("#F8766D","#7CAE00","#00BFC4", "#00BFC4")

ggplot(cs_sub, aes(x = pt_id, y = Z, color = point_type)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = 1), color = 'black') +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = category_color_map) +
  labs(title = glue("Cross section for {target_id} with cs_id {target_cs_id}"),
       x = 'pt_id',
       y = 'Z',
       color = 'Point Type') +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can also have a 3D representation of our flow lines and cross-sections. First, we filter our cross-walk file and flowlines to the target area:

```{r}
hf_ids <- conus_net %>% 
  filter(id == target_id) %>% 
  select(hf_id) %>% 
  collect()

flowlines <- geosptial_output$flowpaths %>% 
  filter(id %in% hf_ids$hf_id) %>% 
  collect()
``` 

The 3D plot:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
grouped_data <- cs_sub %>%
  group_by(cs_id) %>%
  summarize(avg_Z = mean(Z)) %>%
  arrange(avg_Z)

# Initialize plotly object
p <- plot_ly()
p <- add_trace(p, x = ~X, y = ~Y, z = ~Z, type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers",
               marker = list(size = 5),
               data = group_data)
# Add flowlines
for (i in 1:nrow(flowlines)) {
  flowline_geom <- st_geometry(flowlines[i,])
  linestrings_df <- as.data.frame(st_coordinates(flowline_geom))
  colnames(linestrings_df) <- c("X", "Y", "Z")
  
  avg_Z <- min(cs_sub$Z)
  linestrings_df$Z <- avg_Z -0.5
  
  p <- p %>%
    add_trace(
      x = linestrings_df$X,
      y = linestrings_df$Y,
      z = linestrings_df$Z,
      type = 'scatter3d',
      mode = 'lines',
      line = list(color = 'black', width = 2),
      showlegend = FALSE
    )
}

# Customize layout
p <- p %>%
  layout(
    title = '3D plot of cross sections with flowline',
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(title = 'X'),
      yaxis = list(title = 'Y'),
      zaxis = list(title = 'Z (m)')
    ),
    legend = list(title = list(text = 'Average Z'))
  )

p <- layout(p, scene = list(
  aspectmode = "manual",
  aspectratio = list(x = 3, y = 1.5, z = 0.17)
))
# Render the plot
p
```
