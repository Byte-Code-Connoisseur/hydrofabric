Welcome to **DevCon2024**! In the _Hydrofabric Workshop_ we will use R and RStudio. Ideally, you will be able to follow along on your own laptop and it is preferable to have the software on your system before the session.

The document will help get R & RStudio on your own computer, along with several other useful tools or packages. If you have problems, you can contact <a href = "mailto:jjohnson@lynker.com?subject=DevCon 2024 Install help"> Mike Johnson </a>

## Do you already have R installed?

If you have an older versions of R/RStudio installed, we recommend updating. You can check what version of R you are running by typing version in the console of RStudio.

```{r}
version$version.string
```

To check your RStudio version in Windows, click the About RStudio menu option in the Help menu. To check on a Mac, click the About RStudio menu option in the RStudio menu. 

If you donâ€™t have at least R 4.4.XXX and RStudio 2023.6.0.XXXX. We suggest upgrading.
